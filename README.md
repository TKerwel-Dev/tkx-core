## 🧭 Project Status

**TKX Core 0.2.0 – Modernized Architecture Baseline**

The engine has been fully migrated to a modern ESNext + Bundler architecture.

Key characteristics:

- Deterministic ECS Core
- Single World Enforcement
- Strict Lifecycle State Control
- Rendering Isolation via VisualSystem
- Runtime-neutral UUID generation
- Extensionless import policy
- Integrity-verified architecture
- No implicit system registration
- No global state leakage

This version serves as the architectural baseline for all future TKX-based projects, including game implementations such as *Das Erbe der Runen*.

Stability and architectural integrity take priority over feature velocity.

## 📦 Versioning

Versioning follows semantic principles:

- Tags represent stable engine baselines.
- The `VERSION` file reflects the canonical engine version.
- Releases on GitHub represent frozen architectural snapshots.

Current Stable Baseline: **v0.2.0**
